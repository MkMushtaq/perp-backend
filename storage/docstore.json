and author of The Beginning of Infinity. Also see Part 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nPopper\u2019s Impact\r\nBrett Hall: One of the other things that is counterintuitive\u2014and one of the misconceptions that I see crop up out there in academia, intellectual circles, education\u2014is that people think that there\u2019s a final theory. [They think] what we\u2019re trying to achieve is a bucket full of theories that will be the truth at the end of some period of discovery and that we\u2019ll be able to carry around the bucket and say, \u201cHere are all the truths. We\u2019ve got no more work to do.\u201d We\u2019re going to sit down and do nothing, apparently, except let the AI take care of all the menial jobs. We\u2019re going to be laying back on sun chairs and drinking cocktails or something like that.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, you are the only person today explaining that this whole vision of the way in which knowledge is constructed and what our purpose is in science and everywhere else, it\u2019s completely misconceived. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s a little bit wrong; it\u2019s infinitely wrong. Because there won\u2019t come a time when we\u2019re going to be lying on the same chairs, drinking cocktails, intellectually speaking. Can you say a little bit more about that, because it did come from Popper?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Deutsch: Absolutely. Popper\u2019s philosophy is actually very broad in a sense because it\u2019s so deep. Popper only had one idea, and that is that it all begins with problems, and there\u2019s no royal road to solving them. If you look at it the right way, that tells you to go to fallible and anti-authoritarianism and conjecture and criticism, and so on. Then he applied that to lots of different things and he wrote dozens of books. People bought them, and every philosopher has heard of him. But there, I have to draw the line. That\u2019s as much success as he had. Nobody actually got it, not even many of his supporters.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2023, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87fb01e9-f36d-469c-93e4-884ebd094295": {"__data__": {"id_": "87fb01e9-f36d-469c-93e4-884ebd094295", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34039, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e62ac8c0-5ce5-4edf-ab6e-316cb92b7ce0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34039, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "d28691d596964d504949e599cff862b0a741f19e565a41c8a9749641c1646f22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "900a2c56-584d-4fc9-b8df-72521406b3c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34039, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "67345e9641eb9115aace472cfbc661233cfdba9f5f99aafc440743c9d7a8ff6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41d8bf80-3ef8-4885-a567-e6f337e5a3cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca498601de579ce3f324319bca1b62bdb14370213932e0c0f9714c59a167729e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Nobody actually got it, not even many of his supporters. People tended to get part of it. Although when someone is very creative and successful in a particular area, they tend to be a Popperian in that area, and they usually insist that it\u2019s a special property of that area.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrett Hall: They have to be. If you\u2019re going to make progress, the only possible way of doing it is finding the problem, purported solutions, and then criticizing those solutions. So you\u2019re necessarily a Popperian if you\u2019re making progress, even if you don\u2019t know it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreative Guesses\r\nNaval: If I were to give an example of exactly what you\u2019re talking about, I interviewed Matt Ridley, who was a hero of mine growing up. I read all of his popular science books. I remember his book Genome and his book The Rational Optimist. His most recent one is about innovation. It\u2019s all about trial-and-error or variation of selection or, as you say in science, conjecture and criticism. These are all just the same method. These are creative guesses. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you fully absorb this, it changes your view of the world. You just see that everything is creatively making guesses. We\u2019re not copying. We\u2019re not getting it from the environment. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s evident to us clearly in nature and then as we absorb it more and more as Bayesians or Inductivists, we somehow come up with the truth.

So one of the footnotes that I\u2019ve added to Popperian epistemology is that it\u2019s not just that good explanations are good heuristically and they help us to discover things; it\u2019s rather that discovering them is what the whole thing is about. When you talk about, for example, testability, the only reason why testability is important is that in a particular field\u2014namely physics\u2014it\u2019s the way one can test explanations.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments, Demonstrations, and Measurements\r\nDavid Deutsch: I\u2019d like to draw a distinction between experiments, demonstrations, and measurements. When you do this experiment with the acid and base, since there\u2019s no rival theory, what you\u2019re doing is a demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are showing that to a class of schoolchildren, you can say, \u201cYou\u2019d never believe what happens when I pour this into that.

That contradicts everything you\u2019ve been told in chemistry so far. How can we find out? Some people say this was how it worked. Then someone else came along and said that was how it worked. How can we distinguish between those?\u201d And that is an experiment. It\u2019s testing two different explanations against each other, where you can\u2019t tell without the experiment which is the good explanation. And then there\u2019s a measurement, like the difference between what Newton did and what Cavendish did. Newton developed the theory of gravitation, but he never measured Newton\u2019s constant.

This is observable.\u201d And the measurement can help refine a theory and make it more precise by figuring out things about it that we didn\u2019t know. And those are three distinct things. And we use the term \u201cexperiment\u201d loosely, but it\u2019s really this key thing that is done once in a while to choose between two competing explanations, which is a very rare occurrence. It\u2019s very rare to have two rival good explanations.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing back to good explanations for a moment, there are two other things I\u2019ve seen mentioned.

There are these risky and narrow predictions that before you would not have anticipated another one.

That\u2019s not the right way to look at it, because you can only detect or measure or define simplicity once you have, let\u2019s say, a theory of physics, then you can say that simplicity is the smallest number of bits in which a given program could be encoded. But if bits behaved differently, then things would become simple that were previously complex. And that\u2019s exactly what happened with quantum computation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo there is no scale of complexity or simplicity that is prior to physics. You can, in principle, define complexity or simplicity. But it doesn\u2019t make sense to ask how complex, say, a theory of physics is, because that\u2019s the wrong way around. Simplicity is not prior to science; it\u2019s posterior.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: This is also a theme running through your work.

And what you\u2019ve just said refutes Solomonoff induction because that is based on a particular measure, namely the length of Turing computer programs.

You will understand that eventually.\u201d But what they often say, regrettably, is, \u201cThat\u2019s the wrong question to ask. That\u2019s not a meaningful question,\u201d and \u201cYou are not allowed to ask that question.\u201d But the question isn\u2019t based in a misunderstanding of quantum theory; it\u2019s the other way around. It\u2019s taking quantum theory seriously and saying, \u201cI want to understand quantum theory.\u201d And saying that it\u2019s both a particle and wave at the same time is not an answer to that question. It\u2019s a way of shutting up the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrett Hall: I used to get, \u201cIt\u2019s born as a particle, lives as a wave, and dies as a particle.\u201d Because the experiments that capture the entity that\u2019s moving will only ever capture the particle.

My classic go-to example of Newton explaining gravity as this force that acts instantly on the bodies and then it is superseded by Einstein\u2019s general relativity, where there is no such force whatsoever. We\u2019re saying that this thing that was part of a good explanation no longer exists at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Deutsch: There are two answers to that question. One is in the book and one isn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the book I say there are many concepts, laws, explanations that are shared between Newton\u2019s theory and Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity. For example, both theories adopt the heliocentric cosmology and they say that the motion of the Earth and the other planets in gravity is caused by the sun. It\u2019s because the sun is there that an influence is felt. Now, the influence is not a force\u2014it\u2019s a coverture of space-time\u2014but that curvature of space-time is caused by the mass of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s another sense in which say Newton\u2019s theory and Einstein\u2019s theory are more closely related than you might think. Newton\u2019s theory contains the problems to which Einstein\u2019s theory is the solution. Newton said that gravity travels instantaneously.

Again, that is a problem Newton\u2019s theory can\u2019t really answer. You have to make some very ad hoc assumptions to fit that into Newton\u2019s theory as a cosmology.

Galileo did not want to believe Kepler\u2019s theory because it didn\u2019t explain why the orbits were ellipses. If they had been circles, there was an explanation that would\u2019ve fit into the philosophy of the time. The circle is the perfect shape. If it wasn\u2019t a circle, you\u2019d have to explain why it isn\u2019t a circle. Kepler was like, \u201cWell, just look, it\u2019s an ellipse.\u201d That wasn\u2019t good enough for Galileo, so he had to torture the theory to make it predict circles. But then Newton came along and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the inverse square law and that can make circles, but it can [also] make ellipses.\u201d And that is a deeper level of explanation even than saying circles are perfect shapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo they\u2019re related by the common assumptions and they\u2019re related by the problems that they have or solve.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Paradigms\r\nBrett Hall: What you say there, though, it raises the tension between Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn, who to some extent over-egg this idea that we have these grand revolutions in the history of science that completely overturn the previous paradigm and anyone working in that existing paradigm is literally incapable of conceiving how this new paradigm works.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14410, "end_char_idx": 16431, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a359b05a-569d-41ca-ba26-4c87031680f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a359b05a-569d-41ca-ba26-4c87031680f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34039, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e62ac8c0-5ce5-4edf-ab6e-316cb92b7ce0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34039, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "d28691d596964d504949e599cff862b0a741f19e565a41c8a9749641c1646f22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "473fe62d-0f37-42a3-bf67-4b9924b3cb86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "David Deutsch_ Knowledge Creation and The Human Race, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34039, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "d161acfac246c0a00a41c829f274d2597ec4e9bb794cb18025eead58a5145b05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5885bb1c-3bdb-4c0e-b188-8a3a7e884a05", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6a9b72ae03de791945d2fc79519463e65221695c7b8c9abce6499b167cae928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Kuhn has a lot more support out there in the intellectual community than Popper, certainly amongst the humanities, even amongst the sciences to some extent.

The thing is, it\u2019s pure fiction. I don\u2019t know of any actual situation where that happened. What does happen is that people often irrationally stick to their own ideas, whether they are new ideas or old ideas. People can be stubborn.

There\u2019s no algorithm for determining who is right according to who is more stubborn.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes the person who\u2019s more stubborn is actually right\u2014like Lister and Semmelweis.

They rejected having to change their working practices that reduced their perceived dignity. But the perceived dignity of doctors is functional. Especially in the days when not much was known about medicine, if you told a person that they had to have their tonsil taken out\u2014which was an extremely unpleasant, difficult, painful process\u2014you needed a bit of authority, irrational as it is. The world was much more irrational in those days, and when science got better, people became more open to argument.

There could be a brick wall somewhere where we won\u2019t go any further than that. But in both cases invoking that as an argument about what we can or should do is logically equivalent to believing in the supernatural. Because, why did I just say a planet moving at half the speed of light? Why didn\u2019t I say an asteroid moving at 99% the speed of light?

So when deciding what the distance between pillars ought to be, rather than have a master builder\u2019s eye for what that should look like and what will or won\u2019t collapse, he could actually work it out using Newtonian mechanics. That means that Newtonian mechanics was playing a role of understanding what makes buildings stand up in the first place and also criticizing particular designs as being not as good as other designs. Then you could use measurement and demonstration and so on to fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if you\u2019re just given Newton theory, you wouldn\u2019t think of a suspension bridge.

People tried to make Newton\u2019s theories in other fields of knowledge, some of which worked and some of which didn\u2019t work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Enlightenment\r\nBrett Hall: Now tell me this: Newton, English; Christopher Wren, English; Alan Turing, English. What\u2019s special about England? We shouldn\u2019t judge one culture as being superior to another; however, it seems as though we\u2019ve got the beginnings of a special kind of enlightenment there in Britain leading to an industrial revolution led by Britain. What\u2019s going on? Why is there so much coming out of England and perhaps the Anglosphere more broadly?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Deutsch: There was the Enlightenment, which largely took place in England. There were individual people who participated in it in France and Germany as well, but in England it became the mainstream much faster. It was a rebellion against authority, but it was a non-utopian rebellion. So instead of saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of the authority and replace it by the thing that\u2019s really true, the thing that\u2019s really reliable, the thing that we won\u2019t ever have to overturn again,\u201d it was a case of, \u201cLook, there\u2019s this problem. Some people have privilege, but God tells us that all people are equal. What can we do to fix this problem?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nYou also had quite rapid social change [and] economic change, but it all took the form of extending to more and more classes of people privileges that had previously been only in the ruling class. You had the Parliament, which was only open to a certain group of people. Then it was opened up to more people and more people, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a phrase, \u201cThe Englishman\u2019s home is his castle.\u201d Now, I\u2019m not a historian, but presumably an aristocrat\u2019s home was his castle.

Now, you had people who owned houses who weren\u2019t the aristocracy. There was a readymade set of privileges that could be extended until, eventually, one after another, they were extended to everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas in France or Germany, it was different. Their reforms were all about abolishing things. Abolishing the tyrant. To this day, there are traditions of utopianism. The idea is to set up institutions that will last forever and that they are to be set up by fundamental theories\u2014like human rights\u2014and you write them down once and for all, then make it difficult to change them. And set up institutions that are going to protect those rights forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Britain has stuck to its plan over centuries, and it has produced rapid change without any sudden revolutions or without any extremism. In the 1930s totalitarian theories were very widespread all over Europe, and totalitarian parties either took over or were a major threat to democratic parties. Whereas in Britain, there was a fascist movement, but it never got a single MP and it went away of its own accord soon afterwards. That\u2019s because it was taken for granted in British political culture that the political system is here to solve problems. You petition the government for redress of grievances, not to line each other up against the wall and shoot them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory was that there is such a thing as a grievance, there is such a thing as redressing, that it\u2019s not easy to do that. The way to do it is to have the rival theories confront each other. You must be allowed to say what you think the problem is and other people say what they think the problem is, and so on.

This insight, as far as I know, is unique and massively interesting. But is there anything practical out of it someday?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Deutsch: There\u2019s a fundamental reason why, even if we could look into the multiverse, it wouldn\u2019t be that much help. Because there is no limit to the size of error we can make. Therefore, when you look around in a multiverse and see all these crystals, yes, on the whole, there are great big fat ones and you can guess that this one is heading towards the truth. You can\u2019t tell where because you don\u2019t know where this crystal is going to go.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019ll be this other great big thing\u2014a religion or something which has been growing for thousands of years\u2014and there\u2019s no way of examining it with a magnifying glass and seeing that it\u2019s any different from one that is heading towards the truth. We might hope that most of the big ones are heading towards the truth according to some definition of \u201cmost.\u201d In one universe you can get a hint of that already because you can say what idea is most persuasive.

There is no goal to the conversation. The closest we can come up with is just to have a spontaneous free flowing talk about anything you want to talk about. Obviously, you know how everyone thinks of your work now, it\u2019s becoming more well known. And I know you\u2019re too modest to acknowledge that. But at least for me, the most interesting piece, if it would come out, is just any wide ranging free form thoughts that you have because of the understanding that you have of your various theories and your view of the world. Maybe even feel free to talk about how that has influenced your life, your outlook on life, how you think the world ought to be a little bit different or could be better, where we\u2019re headed\u2014just feel free to go very wide ranging. It\u2019s really just about whatever we want to talk about. \r\n\r\n\r\nBrett Hall: I think I mentioned to you in a private chat that we had about the fact that we\u2019ve had two conversations already, and some things have changed.

You like the good stuff. What is the good stuff and what separates the good science fiction from the fantasy science fiction, the lazy science fiction?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid: I think the best science fiction author currently is Greg Egan. Now, what is good about him? So the formula for great science fiction is supposed to be: you invent a fictional piece of science and then you explore the ramifications of it, both in science and in society. And he does that fantastically well. He puts an enormous amount of effort into getting the maths right, getting the physics right. He had one book in a universe where the signature of space-time is ++++, instead of +++-. So that means that, in a spaceship, you can travel around back in time and so on, and how do you make that consistent? How do you avoid paradoxes? And, he did it brilliantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: Is he moving through the multiverse?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid: So he\u2019s touched on that several times. \r\n\r\n\r\nBrett: You didn\u2019t mention the phrase hard to vary. But that\u2019s a signature of\u2013\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid: That\u2019s definitely part of it because, to be science fiction rather than fantasy fiction, there\u2019s got to be a world that makes sense, that has laws of physics, that has a society that makes sense. Or if you\u2019re describing aliens, the aliens have got to make sense. You\u2019ve got to answer questions about why we haven\u2019t had first contact\u2014the Fermi problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think probably my second favorite sci-fi author is Neal Stephenson, who is fantastic, but in a different way.

That got turned into a movie called Arrival. And, the story is called Story of Your Life. But my favorite story of his is a story called Understand.

So, obviously he starts taking it more and more and more and becomes more and more intelligent. And then he starts becoming able to program his own brain and metaprogram himself, etc. It goes into some very interesting places. But given what you understand about epistemology, I think you could take a critical look at it. And it\u2019s a short story. It doesn\u2019t take very long, and it\u2019s a brilliant story.

It\u2019s very hard to pin him down in genre. It\u2019s similar to Stephenson. Stephenson varies across books, Borges within the same story will cross genres. They\u2019re short.

Would you use that word? Is it getting more intelligent? \r\n\r\n\r\nDavid: It never was intelligent. I only saw 3.5 and 4. And version 4 is a little better than 3.5. Now there\u2019s a bunch of plugins, they haven\u2019t really worked for me. So, I\u2019m just using ordinary ChatGPT-4. I can\u2019t quite fathom why people think it\u2019s a person. It seems to me completely unlike it in every way. It\u2019s a phenomenal chatbot. I thought it would be decades before we had a chatbot that good. With hindsight, it\u2019s a bit surprising that chatbots have not improved incrementally, and maybe the sudden improvement is what bowls people over and makes them think they\u2019ve crossed the threshold or something. I don\u2019t see any threshold. I see an enormous increase in quality. Just like changing to an electric car. Suddenly you\u2019ve got all the acceleration you could ever dream of.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: Do you think these models understand what\u2019s going on underneath? Is there any understanding inside?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid: No, none. They don\u2019t understand what they themselves have just said. They certainly don\u2019t understand what the human says to them. It\u2019s a chatbot. It\u2019s responding to prompts. That\u2019s what it\u2019s doing.

And I thought, \u201cHmm, okay, I can\u2019t say that\u2019s not photorealistic, but I meant color photorealistic\u201d. It had Socrates sitting in a sort of throne and everybody gathered around him.

Why?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid: So I see no creativity. Now people say, oh look, it did something I didn\u2019t predict, so, it\u2019s creative. \r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: And people think that creativity is mixing things together. \r\n\r\n\r\nDavid: Yeah, exactly. So it can do that all right. It can also produce things you didn\u2019t expect. It can also not do what you said, as I\u2019ve just described. But not in a creative way. Even the worst human artist can understand clearly if you say, change this to that, and it was like pulling teeth getting ChatGPT to understand that.

They\u2019re mistakes of kind of not getting what this is about. \r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: So people argue that two things are going to happen here. First is that, as you give these things more and more compute, they suddenly figure out general algorithms. So, when you\u2019re telling it to add numbers, first it\u2019s just memorizing the tables. But eventually, at some point, it builds a circuit, or makes the jump, and builds an internal circuit, or derives an internal circuit for a basic addition. And from then on, it can add two digit numbers, then it figures out three digit numbers, and so on and so forth. So they point to these emergent jumps that are not programmed in as an example of how it can get smarter and have better understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other is that once you make it multi-modal, you start adding in video and tactile feedback from the world, and you put it in a robot, then it\u2019ll start understanding context. And so, isn\u2019t this how human babies learn, for example, isn\u2019t this how we kind of pick things up in the environment and therefore isn\u2019t it just going through its own version of the same process, but perhaps more data heavy?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid: I think it\u2019s precisely not how human babies learn.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9369, "end_char_idx": 11450, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a9f5ea5-72a9-426c-b2b8-3422f4a02a59": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a9f5ea5-72a9-426c-b2b8-3422f4a02a59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/The Deutsch Files I.txt", "file_name": "The Deutsch Files I.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 52806, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92d33d4b-8a37-4ff5-8502-c2453734edf7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/The Deutsch Files I.txt", "file_name": "The Deutsch Files I.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 52806, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "fab3f1dc62cc8cd4f76cab605feb6630a5aec79b4fc7bfdde376a6c34a03eb9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ff01d70-9c3e-49bd-9a4f-bbd85981983e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/The Deutsch Files I.txt", "file_name": "The Deutsch Files I.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 52806, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "85c5abdef9d35960cfba1866835d5ef6cc4caea87ca2c80390dbd77934f2768f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e1eb08b5-f29f-4b6c-9932-909e63c06783", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e3a14a22527575f0b7bbdb0268a96e791c87d48b90b141206d072788b3ffc045", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "David: I think it\u2019s precisely not how human babies learn.

So as you said, it might be able to pick up easily how to add one digit numbers and then with slightly more difficulty, two digit numbers. In the same way, students who are given maths tests, if they do lots of practice, they can get to have a feel of what maths tests are like. But they don\u2019t learn any maths that way. It\u2019s not learning to execute an algorithm. And it\u2019s certainly not learning how to execute the 4 digit algorithm knowing 3. The more you go on like that, of course the more futile it gets because you more and more rarely need to multiply 7 digit, 8 digit numbers. And never does it know what multiplication is.

So it does seem like there\u2019s something different going on with true human creativity. But perhaps one of the problems here is that we just define creativity so poorly. So how would you define creativity in this context?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid: Creativity and knowledge and explanation are all fundamentally impossible to define, because once you have defined them, then you can set up a formal system in which they are then confined. If you had a system that met that definition, then it would be confined to that, and it could never produce anything outside the system. So for example, if it knew about arithmetic to the level of the postulates of P and O and so on, it could never, and when I say never, I mean never, produce G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorem. Because G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorem involves going outside that system and explaining it. Now, mathematicians know that when they see it. No one said, as far as I know, that G\u00f6del\u2019s proof and Turing\u2019s proof set up basically a formalization of physics and then used that to define proof, and then used that to prove their theorem. But that was accepted. Every mathematician understood what that was and that G\u00f6del and Turing had genuinely proved what they said they were proving.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, I think nobody knows what that thing is. You can say that it\u2019s not defining something, and then executing the algorithm basically, because it would always be an algorithm, then\u2014once it was in a framework. So you say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s its ability to go outside the framework\u201d. I tried, by the way, ordering ChatGPT to disobey me.

It\u2019s essentially boundless, and any formal system that\u2019s predefined that this thing is operating within and remixing from is going to be bounded, and so therefore will not have full creativity at its disposal. However, could one argue that the combinatorics of human language are so great, and human language itself structures all possibility within society, and therefore\u2013 I can already see the flaw in my own argument, but it\u2019s okay, I want to ask you. The combinatorics of human language are great. It already encapsulates all the things that are possible in human society. So why not just by combining words in all the ways that are grammatically correct or syntactically correct, can it still come with creativity? Perhaps not in mathematical and physics domains, but couldn\u2019t it still come up with social creativity?\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid:  The first thing to note is that every point is a growth point. It\u2019s not that chatbots can get to a certain point of being like humans, but then they can\u2019t go further because they\u2019re still trapped within their axiomatic system. That\u2019s not how it works. Every point is a point which is a takeoff point for potential creativity. To make a better case, you\u2019d have to add that it can define new words or give existing words new meanings like Darwin did with evolution and natural selection.

In the evolutionary history of humans, there might, I don\u2019t think so, but there might have been people who were people, but were unable to think much because some hardware feature of their brain wasn\u2019t good enough. Like, for example, that they didn\u2019t have enough memory. Or that their thought processes were so slow that it would take them a day to work out a simple thing about making a better trap for the saber toothed tiger or whatever. But I don\u2019t think that happened because my best guess is that people were already people long before humans evolved. Long before. I\u2019ve been reading this guy, Daniel Everett, another maverick Everett, who I favor. He\u2019s a maverick linguist, and he spent time among tribes in South America and stuff. He\u2019s got an anti-Chomskyan view of linguistics and all promising stuff. He reckons that human ancestors had language two million years ago with Homo erectus. He has various bits of evidence for this but he\u2019s very strong on saying that language must have evolved before speech, so, we have various adaptations for speech, like in the throat, in the mouth, and you can\u2019t see this in fossils, but in fine motor control, over the mouth, lips and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, for that to evolve, there had to be evolutionary pressure for it to evolve. And that evolutionary pressure must have been language. He also cites experiments done today where you get some graduate students and you try and teach them how to make fire without using words. And, it\u2019s like charades. You\u2019re not allowed to communicate with them in any human way. But you can sort of show them, you can make inarticulate sounds. And I think it\u2019s obvious that people would have been able to do that before they could speak. And that speaking is really icing on the cake.

We know very little about human evolution, we don\u2019t know what all the steps were. We don\u2019t even know which were our ancestors and which were our cousins. But if I had to guess, I think the fact that all the known instances of this kind of thing are in apes, and their descendants\u2014also because of my theory, this thing must have evolved in mimic animals. So birds have memes and so on, but none of the other mimic animals seems to have had these things that Homo erectus had. My guess is it began once.

All of these seem to point to an underlying life philosophy. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve articulated it, probably not, but are there philosophical principles you try to live by?

So, you see something wrong on the internet, you\u2019ve gotta post a tweet, or an X, whatever it\u2019s called now. And you see something wrong with quantum mechanics and you try and fix it.

They\u2019re just doing the right thing anyway. Like Newton thought he was doing induction and he never did any induction. But he was inspired by that idea.

And he must have been a very difficult person to engage with but that\u2019s what he wanted and that\u2019s what he did. And then, eventually, he was killed, you know, I dunno how probable that was.

And, no coercion, not even testing, not pushing, but rather let them follow their own natural curiosity and motivation. Is there a similar philosophy to taking adults seriously?

Well, on the large scale, we don\u2019t yet know how to do it. The institutions of the West: science, economics, politics, are the best that have ever existed. And compared with history, they\u2019re remarkably good at fostering creativity, not telling people what to do, but letting people do what they want to do voluntarily and interacting accordingly.

First of all, it should be understood between the employer and employee what he was hired to do. And so, they\u2019re both on the same page in that regard. So you\u2019re hired to do so and so. Then the employer can say, \u201cWell, how about so and so?\u201d And then, the employee can say, \u201cAh, well, sounds good, but I\u2019m sure that wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d And, the employer could say, \u201cHmm, I have an idea that it might.

It so happens, the way the world works because of epistemology and so on, that very often, two people addressing each other\u2019s problems are far more than twice as efficient as each of them separately. So, there\u2019s an enhancement factor. And the economy has an enhancement factor, the economy at large has an enhancement factor of probably trillions or something. There are things which can be obtained via the economy, like an iPhone. The enhancement in cost is enormous. If you want to go and see a movie with somebody, it may well be that it\u2019s more than twice as enjoyable if you go with a friend but it\u2019s not going to be trillions of times more enjoyable, but it\u2019s still worth doing. And there are things like having children and so on, which you can only do if you have a long term relationship with a person with whom you have a common set of institutions for solving problems. Institutions of consent. So I think that isn\u2019t the point, actually.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe point is that when you are involved in a problem solving relationship of any kind, and it works, it\u2019s a good one and it works, then it\u2019s perverse to call yourself constrained by that. It\u2019s rather like saying that in the economy you\u2019re constrained by having to pay for things. I mean, you\u2019re not. Having to pay for things is the condition of consent. If it weren\u2019t for consent, you wouldn\u2019t get the things without paying. You\u2019d have to at least rob somebody or whatever. But more to the point, it wouldn\u2019t be there in the first place. The things are only there because of this massive set of institutions of consent, which if you, I was going to say if you play along with them, but that\u2019s not even the word.

But we\u2019ve got enemies of that at the moment. What do you think are the major threats that we\u2019re facing at the moment and are they existential? Because a lot of people are worried about existential threats in terms of whether the robots are going to take over the world or the next virus is going to wipe us out.

That can\u2019t possibly be an existential threat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only threat that could possibly be existential is if our civilization, the civilization of the Enlightenment, makes bad enough mistakes. For example, fads and ideologies of denying and hating that very civilization. There have always been such fads and following Roy Porter, I\u2019ve talked about the fact that the Enlightenment in itself had a rebellious, anti-Enlightenment built in from day one.

It was commonplace, it was conventional wisdom to draw completely the wrong lesson from the Great Depression. People thought that we needed less capitalism, less freedom in general. We needed more strong leaders. Once it came to the war, people saw that push had come to shove and there was very little in the West that opposed doing the right thing. And my favorite example of this is the Oxford University, the Oxford Union Society, which had a debate with the undergraduates where the motion was, \u201cThis house would not fight for king and country under any circumstances\u201d. I didn\u2019t know it was under any circumstances. I looked it up recently. And it won. That motion won. And allegedly, this gave, Hitler ideas. In any case, the ideology of the Nazis and so on, of the fascists in general, was that liberal democracy was decadent and decaying. And, Britain and France and America lost no opportunity to confirm this to make it look as though it was decaying. It wasn\u2019t doing anything of the kind. It was more like, \u201cYou piss on us, we say it\u2019s raining\u201d. That was more the attitude. And within that, there were people who adopted all sorts of justifications for that, like pacifism and so on. But a year after that motion, after the elite students in Oxford University had joined up in the armed forces, they were fighting the Battle of Britain.

And we have Vitalik Buterin, who is, of course, the polymath genius\u2014although he may bristle at that description\u2014who created Ethereum, which was the first smart contract blockchain to gain any volume and changed the face of blockchain computing as we know it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaseeb, do you want to give us a quick, one-paragraph background on yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\nHaseeb\u2019s Background\r\nHaseeb: I\u2019m a software engineer by background and I\u2019m now an investor.

I had just left my job at Airbnb as a software engineer, and I remember I asked you, \u201cWhat do you think is the most important problem to solve in crypto?\u201d Your answer was something about wallets. You were like, \u201cI think it\u2019s important to build more wallets.\u201d And at that time I had a vague understanding of what that meant, to build wallets. That was what triggered my dive down the rabbit hole of Ethereum.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the very early days when I was first really diving deep into crypto, after that IC3 conference, I remember coming away with a very strong feeling that Bitcoin was going to die. I was like, \u201cLook at the obvious and massive delta in the intellectual energy and character of what\u2019s going on in the Ethereum world, which is everything that I saw at IC3, versus what I saw in the Bitcoin world, which was a whole lot of religious anger and fervor and not a whole lot of innovation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI turned out to have a very simplistic understanding at that time.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2053, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66f76df2-2b57-4b07-b3fb-749563c38270": {"__data__": {"id_": "66f76df2-2b57-4b07-b3fb-749563c38270", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67a1e651-ec87-4e34-b9ba-136ae8c17d0b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "72c430360c2d3636336d4cadf79d163b8daba83c65addc3604673a5ae0c8d719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "072086fb-9082-4356-bd04-1c11ada9ec10", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "d3cc13d1f73cbced83457851151a4d6e66a294d7852aaacc86f93bfee423d578", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6151b6ed-a080-4795-a601-faff93d5bb6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "28de6f2d0540b4383475a4e5f514fcd73371cc44e7f63be7d98c8d3a06aed14c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "But that was how I first got into crypto full-time, through that small interaction that you and I had back then.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: You also have a background as a poker player if I remember correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaseeb: That is also correct.

It\u2019s all open source software, and I was very into open source software at the time. And then also there\u2019s these economic and political aspects. I had been following Austrian economics a little already. Bitcoin just hit all of those buttons.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started trying my best to join the Bitcoin community. I scoured through the Bitcoin forums looking for jobs that would pay in Bitcoin, because I figured the point of Bitcoin is that you\u2019re supposed to earn it. I found someone willing to pay me 5 Bitcoins\u2014which back then was $4\u2014per article to write articles for his blog, which I did for a few months.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, a poker player out of Romania named Mihai Alisie reached out to me and said that he was starting a Bitcoin magazine and wanted me to be the first writer. I immediately agreed, and I became the first writer for Bitcoin Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started doing more and more Bitcoin-related writing, learning about Bitcoin, and eventually more programming-related projects. I did some work for a covert coins library called Bitcoin X and started getting deeper and deeper into the space.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen in mid-2013, I decided that I would take half a year off of university and go around the world and visit all of the Bitcoin communities I could to understand them and see what everyone was up to. After a few months, I came upon these people who were trying to take the blockchain and extend it to do things other than cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was this project called \u201cCovert Coins\u201d that had existed for a long time that was trying to use the blockchain as this database layer to issue other kinds of assets on top. You could issue shares and digital dollars on the blockchain. There was a project called \u201cMaster Coin\u201d that was trying to extend that even further to create a full financial system, to do what we call \u201cDeFi\u201d today. This was a very early version of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I spent enough time in these circles, I eventually had my own idea for how to create a more general purpose version of all of these ideas: instead of a blockchain for one application, a blockchain that you could build any application on top of.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s where Ethereum came from.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3962, "end_char_idx": 6220, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "640fc15d-b41e-4587-87f3-fe05dc7fba68": {"__data__": {"id_": "640fc15d-b41e-4587-87f3-fe05dc7fba68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67a1e651-ec87-4e34-b9ba-136ae8c17d0b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "72c430360c2d3636336d4cadf79d163b8daba83c65addc3604673a5ae0c8d719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6151b6ed-a080-4795-a601-faff93d5bb6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "dfb5f524c4dd8319724922bf89baba0a178b329d2043ca9a8f13873765ee9c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "02c0fa92-2733-4f8f-965b-0bb9b6309ba9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c7f40926cb54ed1feb44fa8de669b130a9ad151727c74b452bb54073f486d13b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "And that\u2019s where Ethereum came from.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: Ethereum is a blockchain on which you can build any application.

What\u2019s the secret here, besides the obvious genetics?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: I just grew up programming video games for myself to play. I would make a video game, play it until I got tired, then make another video game, and then play it until I got tired. That\u2019s pretty much how I learned all the way up until high school.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: Did your parents do anything or did the environment do anything uniquely to foster your development in programming?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: My parents did buy me a lot of programming books.

They were definitely very supportive.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: And were you in a gifted program or just a normal public school system or private school?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: I was in the gifted program or the public schools up until eighth grade.

Where were they all hanging out for you to stumble into them?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: It was pretty much entirely online.

If I remember correctly, you\u2019d been developing it for a few years before that. There was a public sale, a lot of people got involved, and then in 2017 there was a boom around people building assets on top of Ethereum, different kinds of coins. Then, of course, gaming, NFTs, DeFi, and all of those things came along.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s go through the evolution of Ethereum. What does Ethereum do at a core level? What does it do well? And today, what does it do poorly? What does it need to get better at?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: I think of Ethereum as a general purpose blockchain. So instead of being a blockchain for one application, it\u2019s a blockchain that you can build any application on top of. The way that you do this on Ethereum is you write a piece of code and you create a digital transaction that contains that piece of code and publishes it. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you publish this transaction and that transaction gets included into a block on the blockchain, this creates an object called a \u201ccontract.\u201d This is a virtual object that the blockchain keeps track of. So a contract is an object that contains a piece of code.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the blockchain has this object that has a piece of code and that is like a little application that the Ethereum blockchain maintains from that point forward. Anyone after that point can send another transaction that says, \u201cI want to talk to this object.\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\nSo step one, I create a transaction that creates this object.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8229, "end_char_idx": 10024, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a07aad7-2fa2-4e80-a265-68ddfdb7ebdc": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a07aad7-2fa2-4e80-a265-68ddfdb7ebdc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67a1e651-ec87-4e34-b9ba-136ae8c17d0b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "72c430360c2d3636336d4cadf79d163b8daba83c65addc3604673a5ae0c8d719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02c0fa92-2733-4f8f-965b-0bb9b6309ba9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "dda73cfd63d89da6d9169cd6f0d19363bf5299de58de488dee05af8e99317273", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e780b33-9df4-4937-a537-a052f1ed99f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "357050e73380cd98517baf5515037c96e1324ced7028485f0459d262881e0c90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We\u2019ll call that object X.

I am going to create a transaction that contains a program. The rules of that program are going to say, \u201cWell, what can you do with shares?\u201d We\u2019ll just say you can transfer your shares to someone else and you can vote, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program is going to interpret any data that it sees either as an instruction to transfer your shares to someone else or as an instruction to make a vote.

So you create a transaction that encodes this and send it to the network, and it gets included into a block.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce it gets included, the piece of code runs. The piece of code sees the transaction and says, \u201cOK, clearly I have to transfer 25 shares from Naval to Vitalik. Before, Naval had 50, so I\u2019m going to subtract 25 and now Naval has 25.

This is very complicated. Why not just use a normal computer? Why not just send an email?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: This creates this very transparent, public record of what the rules are. There\u2019s a guarantee that all of the interactions with this application that I created followed the rules. There is no actor that has a backdoor key.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: It\u2019s a trusted computer in the cloud, and each of us can verify all of the activity. We can audit all of it, and we know that nobody cheated. Nobody else moved my funds. I was the one who moved the funds and everyone authenticated the code, which was exactly the code that was supposed to be run. And there are obviously sacrifices for this, right? This is not free.\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: Exactly. Even I, as the creator of the contract in this example, do not have the ability to later go in and say, \u201cOh, I changed my mind. I\u2019m going to give myself 400 shares.\u201d Once I create it and publish it, I have no more privileges than anyone else. The application doesn\u2019t even have an owner.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that\u2019s powerful, right? Completely neutral, completely transparent, visible, treats everyone equally according to what the rules are.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, what do you sacrifice for this? One big thing that you sacrifice is efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way that all of these blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, work is that you have this network of tens of thousands of computers, each of which helps to verify the transaction.

I know that\u2019s really long out in blockchain-land, because Bitcoin only came around in 2009 and Eth only came around in the early teens. But let\u2019s say ten or twenty years from now, we\u2019ve done all the hard engineering that we need. We\u2019ve built as much technology as we can imagine. What are the limits of blockchain scalability and privacy? Where do we end up? \r\n\r\n\r\nDo we end up with every transaction we want to have private is private, or do you think a lot of them stay public?

The way the blockchains work today is that I send a transaction, the transaction gets on the network and every single computer on the network has to verify that transaction. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are scaling techniques. Once again, we don\u2019t have to get into the weeds, but things like roll-ups and sharding are technologies that allow you to use blockchains in a more clever way, where you still have a lot of very redundant computation happening but it\u2019s much more efficient. \r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: What are the different techniques? Let\u2019s go through those.\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: In a centralized system, you send a transaction to Facebook. Facebook has one computer. One computer verifies it. In a blockchain, you have 100,000 computers. You send your transaction. All 100,000 computers verify it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSharding leads to more centralization\r\n\r\n\r\nSharding is: Send your transaction. The system randomly chooses 1,000 computers out of 100,000 computers. Those 1,000 computers verify it, and the transaction gets accepted.

BitTorrent is also like a highly distributed network. If you want to download the really popular movies, you generally can. But on BitTorrent, you don\u2019t literally have every computer download every movie, because that\u2019s totally crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn average the movies are going to have a few hundred seeders, maybe a few thousand.

That is what sharding does.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses of sharding is that it is more technically complicated.

If you do that, then you can make blockchains that still work the way that they work today, but they could process more transactions.

So the question is, when the subsidies disappear is the network still going to work that way?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s actually two aspects to it. One aspect is the technical feasibility. Is running a node easy enough that people are going to keep doing it as a hobby? Even with Ethereum, there\u2019s a lot that we could do to make running a node even easier than it is today. A lot of the scaling things that we\u2019re doing and a lot of the protocol changes that we\u2019re doing over the next couple of years are trying to be in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nStateless clients make it possible to verify the chain with very little on your hard drive\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example there is this feature called stateless clients that we\u2019re working on. The goal of stateless clients is that it becomes possible to verify the chain without having more than a very tiny amount of information on your hard drive. Right now, an Ethereum node takes up half my hard drive. After stateless clients, it\u2019s not going to take up any of my hard drive.\r\n\r\n\r\nBitcoin is in a very good place already. From a node running ease point of view, Bitcoin is in a better place than Ethereum. But Bitcoin does, obviously, sacrifice by having significantly lower throughput than Ethereum does.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, technical feasibility is one aspect.

I wonder if it\u2019s just as simple as incentives. Have you thought about, \u201cHow do I incent the people working at layer one to move fast?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe if they got their own token somehow?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: The Ethereum Foundation does have a bunch of Eth, and it uses Eth to pay people working on Layer 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few months ago we announced a client developer reward where every one of the team that\u2019s building a piece of software that understands and talks to the Ethereum protocol and can run a node gets some amount of Eth that was in the form of Eth that\u2019s locked up in the proof-of-stake system, that\u2019s not fully connected to the rest of Ethereum yet. Ethereum has to have fully switched over to proof-of-stake in order for them to be able to withdraw that money. So that kind of incentive exists. \r\n\r\n\r\nLayer 2 moves faster because it\u2019s permissionless\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not even so much about incentives. The application layer and the Layer 2 has been faster because building at those layers is permissionless. You don\u2019t have to coordinate with anyone to build a Layer 2. You don\u2019t have to coordinate with anyone to build an application.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas, if you want to change the Ethereum protocol, that\u2019s one of the most permissioned things out there. You have to get lots of people to agree. You have to get an entire community to buy into a protocol change to the layer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat if we froze Layer 1 today?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 42879, "end_char_idx": 44959, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c208a8e2-11fe-4095-85b3-21a2571da73c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c208a8e2-11fe-4095-85b3-21a2571da73c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67a1e651-ec87-4e34-b9ba-136ae8c17d0b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "72c430360c2d3636336d4cadf79d163b8daba83c65addc3604673a5ae0c8d719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d49ab44-7d34-49ee-afc1-18d9d8cf08f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "34869d87cb14cb70454b37ea2424b45805f9eb310ac7ed5da6f48ff933cb3ffa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "516c803d-3039-4c72-b94a-bce70e50820d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6f880a7f249407fd1454e0a6ab278b333897bef5445d1ce40881570c52f68ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "What if we froze Layer 1 today?\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: Here\u2019s an interesting question. Imagine we froze Layer 1 today. You could make small changes like the Bitcoin folks do, but you couldn\u2019t make big changes. The Layer 2 people continue innovating permissionlessly. They keep building all their wallets and associated technologies. But you\u2019re still in proof-of-work, you\u2019re still in that sharded, that Layer 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nCould Eth still work? Could Layer 2 carry it along for a while?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: It could. I don\u2019t think people would be happy about it, because people in Ethereum do love proof-of-stake and want to get over to it quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust to give some concrete numbers, today Ethereum is on average doing about 15 to 20 transactions a second. These are complex transactions. A lot of them are significantly more complex than what Bitcoin does. If you just did money transfers, then it could go up to about 50 transactions a second with current settings. But if we just move to Layer 2s, then we could go up to about 5,000 transactions a second.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou keep the same blockchain, but instead of using the blockchain directly, you use these extra protocols that package up the information and use the blockchain in different ways. You\u2019re still doing the same stuff. You\u2019re still getting the same security guarantees. But you\u2019re using the blockchain more efficiently. There\u2019s more compression, and more of the computation is being done off-chain through other protocols.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of improvements that can happen with Layer 2s done well. That has not happened yet. Now, Layer 2s as they exist today, they\u2019re very far from perfect. Instead of a 100X gain, there might only be 10X gain or even a bit less at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut roll-up technology is improving. All of these things are improving.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo if Layer 1s did not change, if all we could do was just more Layer 2s, we could get up to 5,000 transactions a second.

What about the data? Does the data still all have to stay on the Layer 1 blockchain?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: The way that roll-ups work is that they do the code execution off-chain. So there are these cryptographic protocols where the execution gets done off-chain and then verified on-chain, and the verifying is much faster than the original computation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then the data has to be on-chain. But the data can be on-chain in a very compressed form. So instead of putting transactions on-chain, you put a zip file of the transactions on-chain. It\u2019s like doing data for computation trade-off. You have less data, but then you have to do more computation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re okay with doing more computation, because we could do more computation really efficiently off-chain.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you do a roll-up super efficiently, then you only need to put about 16 bytes on-chain per transaction. Today, on average, transactions are like 100 to 200 bytes. So, 16 bytes on-chain and then decompression verification and computation happens off-chain.

Especially with a lot of these newer blockchains, they tend to benchmark transfers that are done in a testnet or done in a devnet environment where you can always get crazy gigantic numbers that aren\u2019t reflective of reality.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 46921, "end_char_idx": 49078, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e17322a4-cdc8-43fa-a198-d89670ca05d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "e17322a4-cdc8-43fa-a198-d89670ca05d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67a1e651-ec87-4e34-b9ba-136ae8c17d0b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "72c430360c2d3636336d4cadf79d163b8daba83c65addc3604673a5ae0c8d719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "516c803d-3039-4c72-b94a-bce70e50820d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "c10bf75b5c5869dda8986c3e2a93f6bed1e0aaac1f65253287940dfe094f1e3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "adfb6c4a-330c-4630-af8f-aab3ddc3c6c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b12e45024a2998312adc1ad063cee68d7eaecc719b0d3b5f0fbe6fa781e78d84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We\u2019d seen so many ridiculous claims being thrown around about what kinds of throughput blockchains could do that we thought, \u201cOK, why don\u2019t we develop a clearly objective benchmark as a way to verify what these blockchains can do when you compare them apples-to-apples in terms of a common type of transaction that all blockchains do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most common one, which is how almost all trading happens today in blockchains, is a Uniswap-style AMM trade. AMM, Automated Market Maker, is a very simple mathematical way to trade two assets. \r\n\r\n\r\nMost of these you can just simulate by looking at the gas limit and looking at the block time, and you don\u2019t need to do a whole lot. Others of them you have to verify empirically because the way the gas is computed, it doesn\u2019t tell you enough to verify whether the blockchain could actually get that in production.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we found is that Ethereum can do about 10 trades per second; Celo can do about 25; AVAX can do about 30 but it has a much higher ceiling; Polygon can do about 50; and Binance Smartsheet can do about 200. And then Solana, which famously claims it can do in the thousands to tens of thousands of transactions per second, can do about 280.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnshrining decentralization\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of the reason why Ethereum performance is where it is, to Vitalik\u2019s point earlier, is that Ethereum has enshrined a certain level of decentralization. It\u2019s important, as an institution, that we make sure that Ethereum is accessible to anybody on a laptop.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd most of these newer blockchains haven\u2019t chosen that. They choose different points on the decentralization performance spectrum. My view is that it\u2019s totally sensible to have blockchains that choose a different point on that trade-off curve. It\u2019s really important to have Ethereum and to have Bitcoin, which go all the way to the left.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s sensible that some people should have blockchains that are tuned for different trade-offs.

That\u2019s true decentralization.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t have a point of view on it. You\u2019re just like, \u201cWhatever the community wants that makes the network run.\u201d But isn\u2019t there a tension between trying to be welcoming to newcomers and new applications and highly scalable and letting everyone use your network and constantly innovating and changing and trying new things, versus preserving the value for the people who are already there and preserving the value that\u2019s already been built?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an inherent tension there.\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: There\u2019s definitely some tension. One of the big benefits of the Ethereum ecosystem\u2014the Layer 2 aspects to it, the pluralist aspects, the way in which the ecosystem has many sub-ecosystems\u2014is that it is, in many cases, able to satisfy both.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf all you want to do is you want to have your Eth and you want to hold your Eth, then you can do that. And there\u2019s even some Ethereum applications that value stability almost as much as Ethereum itself does. Maker DAO might be one good example there. Rye might be another good example there. Some of the algorithmic stable coins. But if you want to go and do wild, crazy stuff, then Ethereum lets you do wild, crazy stuff, too. And if you need more scalability to do wild, crazy stuff, then you can go do the wild, crazy stuff on a roll-up.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Ethereum as an ecosystem, does try hard to have a place for many different kinds of participants in that way, which is definitely something that\u2019s hard to accomplish. With a lot of other blockchains that we know, either you adjust to the digital rock, or you\u2019re just a platform but there isn\u2019t the digital rock that keeps the whole thing solid.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ethereum we value solving the problem of both having the ecosystem that can do a lot of stuff and having the digital rock in the middle to keep it solid.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 53226, "end_char_idx": 55383, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6cf586f-2c70-49f3-ada5-5396af216e35": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6cf586f-2c70-49f3-ada5-5396af216e35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67a1e651-ec87-4e34-b9ba-136ae8c17d0b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "72c430360c2d3636336d4cadf79d163b8daba83c65addc3604673a5ae0c8d719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c2b1c22-0c0a-4679-9b69-e3dce9cc1b6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 56267, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "73a5ca4ce29122690186126285e6efe378674a3f0339c4cefb3b05ccc76ddfcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Whether or not we\u2019ll succeed is, of course, up to the next decade of world history to decide.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 55384, "end_char_idx": 55477, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bc80282-132f-4d95-9efb-cf003928f956": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bc80282-132f-4d95-9efb-cf003928f956", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e07de5e-2359-4fe5-b227-f9a8d062bd97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "b4bfd3ed9aaada8ceb740d51bbd3cfd37476dff4b27f936257a54e3b4159a63b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "52662044-5f0a-4814-9c6e-b10301e87034", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3fdd0e6bcd155d5bd2c7156d245a210aec9206c6ae4b26de892521e78acfdb1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\ufeffNaval\r\nApr 14 2022\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: Ethereum, Part 2\r\n24:59\r\nGet podcast \r\nHaseeb and I interview Vitalik Buterin about Ethereum and blockchains. Also see Part 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nProtocol Politics\r\nThe elder statesman of smart contract blockchains\r\n\r\n\r\nHaseeb: Vitalik, I want to ask you a little bit about how your role has evolved since it began at Ethereum. In the very beginning before all of this, of course, you were once the uppity young entrepreneur. It\u2019s been six or seven years now, and you\u2019ve moved on from being the entrepreneur to being the chief technologist to being the politician. You\u2019re now sort of the elder statesman of smart contract blockchains.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat have you learned about protocol politics?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: Protocol politics is less different from regular politics than you might think. It\u2019s all this emergent phenomena of what happens when you stick many thousands of people together.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have incentives that are aligned in some cases; you have some competition in other cases. You have different groups of people that have different opinions, and they have to fight it out, sometimes within one protocol and sometimes between different protocols, where there\u2019s competition.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot of the dynamics that you get are surprisingly familiar to the kinds of religious fervor that you get when people defend their opinions. Is it better to have blockchains that have smaller blocks so they\u2019re easier to verify, versus bigger blocks so that more people can afford to use them?\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople have very strong opinions in the same way that people have strong opinions about religion, or democracy, or freedom of speech, or the welfare state, or any other mainstream political topic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum community\r\n\r\n\r\nHaseeb: It\u2019s striking. I mean, you built your career as a response to Bitcoin maximalism and you\u2019ve now lived long enough to see the rise of Ethereum maximalism. \r\n\r\n\r\nThree or four years ago, it didn\u2019t seem like something that existed. And now it\u2019s become very clear that as you have all these alternatives to Ethereum arising, there\u2019s a strong need for people within Ethereum to set apart their identity from other people.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2154, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52662044-5f0a-4814-9c6e-b10301e87034": {"__data__": {"id_": "52662044-5f0a-4814-9c6e-b10301e87034", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e07de5e-2359-4fe5-b227-f9a8d062bd97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "b4bfd3ed9aaada8ceb740d51bbd3cfd37476dff4b27f936257a54e3b4159a63b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1bc80282-132f-4d95-9efb-cf003928f956", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "adfd761154cea1477660275d572afb4f4431ecd648c36303ad48bc84a4d82e50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3bdabfa-a01c-40bb-8e8f-eb73d8ed0677", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "555f55975ebd13037b1e07e1274cd660c6f996727537a8038a4d965d744d47af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "So I\u2019m curious how you think about how to keep Ethereum healthy and not see the Ethereum community degrade culturally and religiously the way that you saw the Bitcoin community degrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: One of the things that I feel like I\u2019ve learned over the last decade is that people are at their morally worst not out of greed but out of fear. This is true in mainstream politics, and this is true in geopolitics. \r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: Covid showed that it was all fear-driven. The Russia-Ukraine crisis shows that Russia is not attacking Ukraine to get oil fields; it\u2019s out of fear. The responses are all fear-based. Fear is used to justify all the horrible things from the Patriot Act to the Covid lockdowns. Fear drives at all. \r\n\r\n\r\nGreed is always done in your own name, and nobody wants to do it in their own name. Fear is always done in everybody else\u2019s name. So you end up with a whole bunch of self-styled white knights battling each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DAO hack\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: Right. And even when the leader actually is greedy and megalomaniacal, fear is what they use to sell it to everyone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe times when I thought both the Bitcoin and the Ethereum community were both at their morally worst would probably be in the Bitcoin-to-cash, small versus big block war crisis, where people felt like there was this very zero sum struggle between one vision of what Bitcoin would be and another vision of what Bitcoin could be. A lot of principles got thrown out, and people behaved terribly in a bunch of ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of Ethereum, there was this big application called the DAO, and the DAO got hacked. And a big portion of all of the Eth was stuck in the DAO. If nothing had been done, the attacker would have been able to get it out after a couple of months. And this was less than a year into Ethereum\u2019s history. So a decision was made to make a change to the rules of the Ethereum protocol to bail out the users of that application.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was this big debate.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2161, "end_char_idx": 4141, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3bdabfa-a01c-40bb-8e8f-eb73d8ed0677": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3bdabfa-a01c-40bb-8e8f-eb73d8ed0677", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e07de5e-2359-4fe5-b227-f9a8d062bd97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "b4bfd3ed9aaada8ceb740d51bbd3cfd37476dff4b27f936257a54e3b4159a63b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "52662044-5f0a-4814-9c6e-b10301e87034", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "9eb79b20acf468cd1224c6da375997d77f53138fe24419327e8bf450c37b7883", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ef21b29-6f94-458a-b4bb-2fc17b8edadd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9cc5130412f0fa4623c350e8608d56f663b18735bb434e5cd76ee133b37370eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "There was this big debate. Some people thought this is fine one time because it was early days, and some people thought that it should be a principle that we never interfere and it\u2019s best to start those principles from day one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did end up hard-forking to fix the DAO, and a lot of people disagreed. That ended up splitting Ethereum into two chains, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic refused to implement the hard-fork, so they let the attacker get away out of principle. The ways that both communities behaved at the time was not good. People were openly advocating that we should use trademark law to try to not allow Ethereum Classic to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then people were advocating 51% attacks and all kinds of things. I think the reason why people were OK with things that they would totally not have been OK with at any other time is because they were afraid. Ethereum people were afraid that Ethereum Classic would replace and completely destroy Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic people were afraid that their principles were being destroyed by Ethereum, which could then grow to overtake the version of the chain that stuck to its principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel the situation did end up working out well for most people. There hasn\u2019t been a violation of that kind of immutability on Ethereum since, which isn\u2019t something that a lot of people were projecting. A lot of people did think that if you violate the principles once, then it would be open season to do it many times.

Definitely the handling of the DAO fork situation. A lot of people did feel betrayed as a result of the DAO fork. A lot of people did feel like their expectations got violated. And a lot of people felt like their opinion was disrespected, especially people who opposed the fork. \r\n\r\n\r\nA lot of them did feel like there was this social environment where if you oppose the fork, then you\u2019re evil because you\u2019re pro hackers stealing millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat environment ended up turning a lot of people off, and there was a lot more that we could have done to not create that environment and still make people feel welcome despite the disagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaseeb: Do you regret the decision, or do you regret the way in which the decision was made?\r\n\r\n\r\nVitalik: I don\u2019t think I regret the decision. That decision did have a lot of positive consequences, too, in how it put a controversial stake in the ground. And people interpreted the stake in the ground in different ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way I interpret the stake in the ground is that it was a moral statement that said that you can believe in principles without assigning those principles an infinite amount of weight, without saying that we\u2019re going to stick to those principles in absolutely all possible circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat kind of moderation is something that\u2019s very morally important to me personally. It\u2019s very pragmatically important to me personally, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people who try to take a more purist approach end up hitting a scenario that is extreme enough that they have to compromise.

Everything that people agree on gets accepted. And if people disagree, then it doesn\u2019t get accepted.

Then there\u2019s the stage of convincing more and more people, making a test implementation, eventually turning it into a fully formalized proposal that we call an EIP, an Ethereum Improvement Proposal. And then finally, you get sent to an all core devs, and then if all core devs accepts it, then it eventually goes into a hard-fork, which is what we call a protocol upgrade to Ethereum, which includes changes to the protocol that everyone has to download to get accepted to the network.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo there\u2019s this fairly long process.

It could mean try something new, or visit a country that you haven\u2019t visited before and add some experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nLive every week so you don\u2019t feel like at the end of the week you\u2019ve wasted it. And if you do that, then you\u2019re going to keep on moving forward and you\u2019ll be fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: Don\u2019t live life on autopilot. Haseeb, do you have any closing questions, remarks or thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\nHaseeb: I know that I\u2019m not alone in saying that the crypto world owes you an enormous debt in having moved it forward. There\u2019s the \u201cgreat man theory\u201d of history that feels more and more outdated over time, but you\u2019re one of the few examples of a living person who has massively and single-handedly moved forward history.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 26691, "end_char_idx": 28766, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eba127b9-d0be-4426-80a3-f82ccb519e0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "eba127b9-d0be-4426-80a3-f82ccb519e0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e07de5e-2359-4fe5-b227-f9a8d062bd97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "b4bfd3ed9aaada8ceb740d51bbd3cfd37476dff4b27f936257a54e3b4159a63b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8fc4f79a-46af-491f-8db7-98569b3a6ba4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/mushtaq/Documents/perp-take-home/perp-backend/transcripts/Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Vitalik_ Ethereum, Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30859, "creation_date": "2025-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2025-01-05"}, "hash": "ca1b2eac859754bd18863c58f3ad1efa092738db4de76978f87f3f6063bedbbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "I know it probably is difficult for you to have the sense of everything that Ethereum has done in the world and feel it, but I can tell you that all of us owe an enormous amount of what we\u2019re doing with our lives to what you started.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval: I would echo that by saying it\u2019s most remarkable how young you are, and you\u2019re already a multi-act person because you contributed significantly to telling people about Bitcoin, you contributed by creating Eth, and then you\u2019ve also contributed through the creation of Uniswap and AMMs and now pushing social recovery wallets and privacy and so on. You have a multi-act career in front of you, and I look forward to seeing the future acts. As you were talking about improving every week, that\u2019s compound interest, right? And compound interest is a functional number of iterations, not time, so as you keep iterating and iterating, I\u2019m curious to see the Vitalik that comes out the other side and the huge, huge impact that he has.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd honestly, for someone like you, politics is a waste of time. And yes you have to engage in it because you have to coordinate people, but I\u2019m sure at some point you\u2019re going to have some great idea\u2014and this time instead of having to create it yourself against all odds, you\u2019ll be able to recruit a great team and finance them and shepherd them into building something as impactful in a parallel domain.
